Introduction

Node is a javascript runtime.
While js is a programming language used in the browser to interact with the page, Node allows to run JS on the server (any machine).

Node uses V8 which is a JS engine built by google which runs JS on the browser. The engine takes JS code and compiles it to machine code.
V8 itself is written in C++, though no knowlege of C++ is necessary to work with V8. Node adds functionality that is necessary outside of the browser like working with the file system or other elements of machines. 

JS on the server

We would typically us Node to write server side code. 
Traditionaly a user would use the browser to interact with a client side app. The browser would render HTML, CSS, and JS to display elements and let the user interact with the page like clicking a button or scrolling or writing something into a form. 

When a user makes a request to a website (using the url or http requests  like get and post), a request is sent to a url (an adress of a server), and then the server will need to execute some code that will process the request and then will sent a response. Often the response would be some HTML code, but it doesn't have to be. 

That segmentation is usefull because there are often tasks that we don't want to do from inside the broewser. Tasks like those may include: authentication, connection to a DB, for any performance or security reasons.
Similerly all that the user souldn't see but needs to be executed, also called the business logic, will be run from  the server and not on the client. 

**Nodejs is not limited to run on a server. We can execute JS on node anywhere. 

In terms of web development Node runs and  maintains the servers, executes business logic, and sends back responses. 

There are two main ways to execute NodeJS code:
1. REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
2. Execute files with node
